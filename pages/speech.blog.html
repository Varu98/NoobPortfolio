      <h1>Change Your Mindset If You Are Studying In A College</h1>
      <p class="blogp">Guys and Gals,</p>

      <p class="blogp">
        I have recently been getting lot of doubts regarding coding so I thought
        of sharing with you guys what i know about coding, job industry and how
        to kickstart yourself being in a private college(you know what I mean).
      </p>

        So this is a step forward in holding hands togather and pushing each
        other forward because looking at the bigger picture, competiton among us
        and keeping knowledge away from each other will not help at all. What I
        mean to say is that maybe you know stuff that I dont or maybe I know
        stuff that you dont so hiding it away in our own space might make you
        better over others but pause for a second and look back and realise, you
        will be ruling over noobs whereas you are helping others pushing them to
        do something better you are improving your own social circle that is
        going to stick with you through the rest of the 3 years of college and
        you are challenging yourself to match up to the standards of people you
        teach.

        "College tho select kar liya batch bhi decide ho gayi but ab us batch ko
        gaali deni hein ya fir saath mein aage bhadna hein that totally depends
        on you."

        see I am from a residential school and no matter we had different
        friends and all but there was a sense of togatherness among us because
        over there friends were family and they still are, so many people are
        going to be relocating from different parts of India and coming to
        greno, so what is better than joining supportive batch mates in the
        college itself
      </p>

      <p class="blogp">
        I believe we can help each other out if we are togather in it, come up
        with what you are good at teach your skill to others take
        initiative...Honestly if you have such kind of attitude or can atleast
        practise on it your career will reach new heights I can promise you
        about that as I have seen this happen.

        lambi speech hein but pls try to change your mindset to a healthy one if
        you are really serious about your career, college mein aa gaye ho yaar
        grow up and think up of something that everyone can benefit from maybe
        you could turn the same into an empire...thats how many businesses have
        shot up.

        Kuch nhi to atleast dream big. Selections open for students with the
        same growth oriented mindset...you will be part of a community of like
        minded people . Reading this message any idea pops in your head pls
        share I am open to suggestions. Send me a dm on same whatsapp number.
        Also note we are lacking on communities in this college so I can assure
        you about that I planning to create our own. Discord is neccesary.
        anybody disagrees to this totally fine. you can go your own way. no
        grudges will be held against you, hatred is not my thing. PS: I am also
        doing this so that I can solve your doubts at once rather than
        individually messaging to everybody. ðŸ˜…
